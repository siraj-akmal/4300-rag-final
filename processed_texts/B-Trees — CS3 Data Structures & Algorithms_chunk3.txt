process, beginning with the root node of the B- tree. 1. Perform a binary search on the records in the current node. If a record with the search key is found, then return that record. If the current node is a leaf node and the key is not found, then report an unsuccessful search. m ⌈m/2⌉ m 24 15 20 33 45 48 10 12 18 21 23 30 30 38 47 50 52 60 3/17/25, 9:22 AM 12.6.

For example, consider a search for the record with key value 47 in the tree of Figure 12.6.1. The root node is examined and the second (right) branch taken. After examining the node at level 1, the third branch is taken to the next level to arrive at the leaf node containing a record with key value 47. B-tree insertion is a generalization of 2-3 tree insertion. The first step is to find the leaf node that should contain the key to be inserted, space permitting. If there is room in this node, then insert the key. If there is not, then
