21 Reference: https://alperenbayramoglu.com/posts/understanding-cap-theorem/ - Consistency + Availability: System always responds with the latest data and every request gets a response, but may not be able to deal with network issues - Consistency + Partition Tolerance: If system responds with data from a distributed store, it is always the latest, else data request is dropped. - Availability + Partition Tolerance: System always sends are responds based on distributed store, but may not be the absolute latest data. CAP in Reality What it is really saying: - If you cannot limit the number of faults, requests can be directed to any server, and you insist on serving every request, then you cannot possibly be consistent. But it is interpreted as: - You must always give up something: consistency, availability, or tolerance to failure. 22 ?? 23
