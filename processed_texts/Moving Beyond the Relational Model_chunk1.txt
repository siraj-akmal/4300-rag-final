Help ensure - Data Integrity - Error Recovery - Concurrency Control - Reliable Data Storage - Simpliﬁed Error Handling 4 ACID Properties - Atomicity - transaction is treated as an atomic unit - it is fully executed or no parts of it are executed - Consistency - a transaction takes a database from one consistent state to another consistent state - consistent state - all data meets integrity constraints 5 ACID Properties - Isolation - Two transactions T1 and T2 are being executed at the same time but cannot affect each other - If both T1 and T2 are reading the data - no problem - If T1 is reading the same data that T2 may be writing, can result in: - Dirty Read - Non-repeatable Read - Phantom Reads 6 Isolation: Dirty Read 7 Figure from: https://www.mybluelinux.com/relational-databases-explained/ Dirty Read - a transaction T1 is able to read a row that has been modiﬁed by another transaction T2 that hasn’t yet executed a COMMIT Isolation: Non-Repeatable Read 8 Figure from: https://www.mybluelinux.com/relational-databases-explained/ Non-repeatable Read - two queries in a single transaction T1 execute a SELECT but get different values because another transaction T2 has changed data and COMMITTED Isolation: Phantom Reads
