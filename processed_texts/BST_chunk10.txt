So, we will view the process as follows: A key x from the keys is selected uniformly at random and is inserted to the tree. Then all the other keys are inserted. Here all the keys greater than x go into the right subtree of x and all the keys smaller than x go into the left subtree. Thus, the height of the tree thus constructed is one plus the larger of the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree. 23 Random Variables n = number of keys Xn = height of the tree of n keys Yn = 2Xn. We want an upper bound on E[Yn]. For n ≥2, we have E[Yn] = 1 n   n X i=1 2E[max{Yi−1, Yn−i}]  . E[max{Yi−1, Yn−i}] ≤ E[Yi−1 + Yn−i] ≤ E[Yi−1] + E[Yn−i] Collecting terms: E[Yn] ≤4 n n−1 X i=1 E[Yi]. 24 Analysis We claim that for all n ≥1 E[Yn] ≤1 4 n+3 3  . We prove this by induction on n. Base case: E[Y1] = 20 = 1. Induction step: We have E[Yn] ≤4 n n−1 X i=1 E[Yi] Using the fact that n−1 X i=0 i + 3
