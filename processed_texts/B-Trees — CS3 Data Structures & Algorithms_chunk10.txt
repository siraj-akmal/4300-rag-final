tree works. This would be the “ tree”, or a tree of order 3. Figure 12.6.2: An example of building a tree Next, let’s see how to search.

Once the first record in the range has been found, the rest of the records with keys in the range can be accessed by sequential processing of the remaining records in the first node, and then continuing down the linked list of leaf nodes as far as necessary. Figure illustrates the tree. Figure
