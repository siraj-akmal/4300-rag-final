the graph Weighted (vs. Unweighted) – edge has a weight property (important for some algorithms) Directed (vs. Undirected) – relationships (edges) deﬁne a start and end node Acyclic (vs. Cyclic) – Graph contains no cycles 8 Connected vs. Disconnected 9 Weighted vs. Unweighted 10 Directed vs. Undirected 11 Cyclic vs Acyclic 12 Sparse vs. Dense 13 Trees 14 Types of Graph Algorithms - Pathﬁnding - Pathﬁnding - ﬁnding the shortest path between two nodes, if one exists, is probably the most common operation - “shortest” means fewest edges or lowest weight - Average Shortest Path can be used to monitor efﬁciency and resiliency of networks. - Minimum spanning tree, cycle detection, max/min ﬂow… are other types of pathﬁnding 15 BFS vs DFS 16 Shortest Path 17 Types of Graph Algorithms - Centrality & Community Detection - Centrality - determining which nodes are “more important” in a network compared to other nodes - EX: Social Network Inﬂuencers? - Community Detection - evaluate clustering or partitioning of nodes of a graph and tendency to strengthen or break apart 18 Centrality 19 Some Famous Graph Algorithms - Dijkstra’s Algorithm - single-source shortest path algo for positively weighted graphs - A* Algorithm - Similar
