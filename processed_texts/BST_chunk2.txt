How about postorder traversal and preorder traversal? 5 Inorder traversal gives: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 11, 12, 15, 19, 20. Preorder traversal gives: 7, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 12, 9, 8, 11, 19, 15, 20. Postorder traversal gives: 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 8, 11, 9, 15, 20, 19, 12, 7. So, inorder travel on a BST ﬁnds the keys in nondecreasing order! 6 Operations on BST 1. Searching for a key We assume that a key and the subtree in which the key is searched for are given as an input. We’ll take the full advantage of the BST-property. Suppose we are at a node. If the node has the key that is being searched for, then the search is over. Otherwise, the key at the current node is either strictly smaller than the key that is searched for or strictly greater than the key that is searched for. If the former is the case,
