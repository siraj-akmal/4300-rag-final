Document Database A Document Database is a non-relational database that stores data as structured documents, usually in JSON. They are designed to be simple, ﬂexible, and scalable. 2 What is JSON? ● JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) ○ a lightweight data-interchange format ○ It is easy for humans to read and write. ○ It is easy for machines to parse and generate. ● JSON is built on two structures: ○ A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is operationalized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. ○ An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is operationalized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. ● These are two universal data structures supported by virtually all modern programming languages ○ Thus, JSON makes a great data interchange format. 3 JSON Syntax 4 https://www.json.org/json-en.html Binary JSON? BSON - BSON → Binary JSON - binary-encoded serialization of a JSON-like document structure - supports extended types not part of basic JSON (e.g. Date, BinaryData, etc) - Lightweight - keep space overhead to a minimum -
