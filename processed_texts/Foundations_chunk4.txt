But what if we want to search for a speciﬁc specialVal? ○ Only option is linear scan of that column ● Can’t store data on disk sorted by both id and specialVal (at the same time) ○ data would have to be duplicated → space inefﬁcient 11 We need an external data structure to support faster searching by specialVal than a linear scan. What do we have in our arsenal? 1) An array of tuples (specialVal, rowNumber) sorted by specialVal a) We could use Binary Search to quickly locate a particular specialVal and ﬁnd its corresponding row in the table b) But, every insert into the table would be like inserting into a sorted array - slow… 2) A linked list of tuples (specialVal, rowNumber) sorted by specialVal a) searching for a specialVal would be slow - linear scan required b) But inserting into the table would theoretically be quick to also add to the list. 12 Something with Fast Insert and Fast Search? - Binary Search Tree - a binary tree where every node in the left subtree is less than its parent and every node in the right subtree is greater than its parent. 13 Image from: https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2019/notes/bst/
