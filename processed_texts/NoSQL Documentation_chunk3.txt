Test equality of field to a constant value, e.g. { A: 6 } => Is A equal to 6? 2. Compare a field using a comparison operator, e.g. { A: { $gt: 8 }} => Is A greater than 8? . The set of comparison operators is quite extensive and includes: $lte, $lt, $gte, $gt, $eq, $neq, $not 3. Test if the value of the field is IN or NOT IN the result of a sub-query. 4. Test for the negation of a comparison. For example, to test if the location field is not Boston, we can do: { "$not": { "location" : "Boston" }} Sub Queries The following sub-query retrieves the department ID of each department in New York: { "object": "department", "q": { "city" : "New York" }, "fields" : ["id"]} latest Using this subquery, we can now test a new field - dept_id - with respect to
