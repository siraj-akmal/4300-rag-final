This visualization was written by David Galles of the University of San Francisco as part of his Data Structure Visualizations package. [1] This concept can be extended further if higher space utilization is required. However, the update routines become much more complicated. I once worked on a project where we implemented 3-for-4 node split and merge routines. This gave better performance than the 2-for-3 node split and merge routines of the tree. However, the spitting and merging routines were so complicated that even their author could no longer understand them once they were completed! 12.6.1.2. B-Tree Analysis The asymptotic cost of search, insertion, and deletion of records from B-trees, trees, and trees is where is the total number
