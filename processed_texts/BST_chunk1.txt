visiting all the nodes in a graph. Traversal strategies can be speciÔ¨Åed by the ordering of the three objects to visit: the current node, the left subtree, and the right subtree. We assume the the left subtree always comes before the right subtree. Then there are three strategies. 1. Inorder. The ordering is: the left subtree, the current node, the right subtree. 2. Preorder. The ordering is: the current node, the left subtree, the right subtree. 3. Postorder. The ordering is: the left subtree, the right subtree, the current node. 3 Inorder Traversal Pseudocode This recursive algorithm takes as the input a pointer to a tree and executed inorder traversal on the tree. While doing traversal it prints out the key of each node that is visited. Inorder-Walk(x) 1: if x = nil then return 2: Inorder-Walk(left[x]) 3: Print key[x] 4: Inorder-Walk(right[x]) We can write a similar pseudocode for preorder and postorder. 4 preorder postorder inorder 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 2 3 6 5 12 9 8 11 15 19 20 7 What is the outcome of inorder traversal on this BST? How about postorder traversal and preorder traversal? 5 Inorder traversal gives: 2,
