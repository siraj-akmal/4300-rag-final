DS 4300 Amazon EC2 & Lambda Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Based in part on material from Gareth Eagar’s Data Engineering with AWS, Packt Publishing EC2 2 EC2 ●EC2 → Elastic Cloud Compute ●Scalable Virtual Computing in the Cloud ●Many (Many!!) instance types available ●Pay-as-you-go model for pricing ●Multiple different Operating Systems 3 Features of EC2 ●Elasticity - easily (and programmatically) scale instances up or down as needed ●You can use one of the standard AMIs OR provide your own AMI if pre-conﬁg is needed ●Easily integrates with many other services such as S3, RDS, etc. 4 AMI = Amazon Machine Image EC2 Lifecycle ●Launch - when starting an instance for the ﬁrst time with a chosen conﬁguration ●Start/Stop - Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance ●Terminate - Permanently delete the instance ●Reboot - Restart an instance without sling the data on the root volume 5 Where Can You Store Data? - Instance Store: Temporary, high-speed storage tied to the instance lifecycle - EFS (Elastic File System) Support - Shared ﬁle storage - EBS (Elastic Block Storage) - Persistent block-level storage - S3 - large data set storage or EC2 backups even 6 Common EC2 Use Cases ●Web Hosting
