process through several examples. Figure 12.6.6: An example of building a B+ tree of order four. Here is a a Java-like pseudocode sketch of the tree insert algorithm. private BPNode<Key,E> inserthelp(BPNode<Key,E> rt, Key k, E e) { BPNode<Key,E> retval; if (rt.isLeaf()) { // At leaf node: insert here return ((BPLeaf<Key,E>)rt).add(k,
