routines of the tree. However, the spitting and merging routines were so complicated that even their author could no longer understand them once they were completed! 12.6.1.2. B-Tree Analysis The asymptotic cost of search, insertion, and deletion of records from B-trees, trees, and trees is where is the total number of records in the tree. However, the base of the log is the (average) branching factor of the tree. Typical database applications use extremely high branching factors, perhaps 100 or more. Thus, in practice the B-tree and its variants are extremely shallow. As an illustration, consider a tree of order 100 and leaf nodes that contain up to 100 records. A B- tree with height one (that is, just a single leaf node) can have at most 100 records. A tree with height two (a root internal node whose children are leaves) must have at least 100 records (2 leaves with 50 records each). It has at most 10,000 records (100 leaves with 100 records each). A tree with height three must have at least 5000 records (two second-level nodes with 50 children containing 50 records each) and at most one million records (100 second-level nodes with 100 full children
