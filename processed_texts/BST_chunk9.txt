 Set the parent’s right child to x. 23: if y ̸= z then 24: { key[z] ←key[y] 25: Move other data from y to z } 27: return (y) 20 Summary of Eﬃciency Analysis Theorem A On a binary search tree of height h, Search, Minimum, Maximum, Successor, Predecessor, Insert, and Delete can be made to run in O(h) time. 21 Randomly built BST Suppose that we insert n distinct keys into an initially empty tree. Assuming that the n! permutations are equally likely to occur, what is the average height of the tree? To study this question we consider the process of constructing a tree T by inserting in order randomly selected n distinct keys to an initially empty tree. Here the actually values of the keys do not matter. What matters is the position of the inserted key in the n keys. 22 The Process of Construction So, we will view the process as follows: A key x from the keys is selected uniformly at random and is inserted to the tree. Then all the other keys are inserted. Here all the keys greater than x go into the right subtree of x and all the keys
