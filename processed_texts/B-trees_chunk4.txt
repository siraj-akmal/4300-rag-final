the process ripples upwards, eventually possibly reaching the root. If the root is split into two, then a new root is created with just two children, increasing the height of the tree by one. For example, here is the effect of a series of insertions. The first insertion (13) merely affects a leaf. The second insertion (14) overflows the leaf and adds a key to an internal node. The third insertion propagates all the way to the root. Deletion works in the opposite way: the element is removed from the leaf. If the leaf becomes empty, a key is removed from the parent node. If that breaks invariant 3, the keys of the parent node and its immediate right (or left) sibling are reapportioned among them so that invariant 3 is satisfied. If this is not possible, the parent node can be combined with that sibling, removing a key another level up in the tree and possible causing a ripple all the way to the root. If the root has just two children, and they are combined, then the root is deleted and the new combined node becomes the root of the tree, reducing the height of the tree by
