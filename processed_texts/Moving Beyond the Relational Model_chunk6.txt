Theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: - Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or error thrown - Availability - Every request receives a (non-error) response - but no guarantee that the response contains the most recent write - Partition Tolerance - The system can continue to operate despite arbitrary network issues. CAP Theorem - Database View 20 Reference: https://alperenbayramoglu.com/posts/understanding-cap-theorem/ - Consistency*: Every user of the DB has an identical view of the data at any given instant - Availability: In the event of a failure, the database remains operational - Partition Tolerance: The database can maintain operations in the event of the networkâ€™s failing between two segments of the distributed system * Note, the definition of Consistency in CAP is different from that of ACID. CAP Theorem - Database View 21 Reference: https://alperenbayramoglu.com/posts/understanding-cap-theorem/ - Consistency + Availability: System always responds with the latest data and every request gets a response, but may not be able to deal with network issues - Consistency + Partition Tolerance: If system responds with data from a distributed store, it is always the latest, else
