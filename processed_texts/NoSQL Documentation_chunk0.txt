A query consists of these parts: 1. fields to be extracted 2. table to extract the records from 3. expression for filtering the table rows 4. groupby - fields to group the data under 5. aggregate functions to be applied to columns in fields 6. orderby - fields to order the return data by 7. limit - an integer number of records to return. Only the table and expression parameters are mandatory. The NoSQL queries are then constructed into a SQL query of the following form: SELECT fields with aggregation FROM table WHERE expression GROUP BY groupby ORDER BY orderby LIMIT limit NoSQL queries are constructed using JSON objects. Below is an example: { object: String, q: Expression, fields: Array of String, groupBy: Array of String, aggregation: Object mapping fields to aggregate functions } For example, the shortest query you can write would be: { "object": "String", "q": "Expression" } This NoSQL object is converted into: SELECT * FROM table WHERE query latest Examples This simple query retrieves the name and salary of all employees in position of "Sales Manager": { "object":
