parent; rearrange keys and pointers in parent node. ● Parent of newNode is also root. So, nothing else to do. 7 B+ Tree : m = 4 Fast forward to this state of the tree… ● Observation: The root node is full. ○ The next insertion that splits a leaf will cause the root to split, and thus the tree will get 1 level deeper. 8 B+ Tree : m = 4 Insert 37. Step 1 9 B+ Tree : m = 4 Insert 37. Step 2. ● When splitting an internal node, we move the middle element to the parent (instead of copying it). ● In this particular tree, that means we have to create a new internal node which is also now the root.
