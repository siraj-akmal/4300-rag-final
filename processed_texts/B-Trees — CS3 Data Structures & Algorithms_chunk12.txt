First, the leaf that should contain the record is found. If is not full, then the new record is added, and no other tree nodes are affected. If is already full, split it in two (dividing the records evenly among the two nodes) and promote a copy of the least-valued key in the newly formed right node. As with the 2-3 tree, promotion might cause the parent to split in turn, perhaps eventually leading to splitting the root and causing the tree to gain a new level. tree insertion keeps all leaf nodes at equal depth.
