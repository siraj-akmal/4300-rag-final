For which node is the successor undeﬁned? What is the running time of the successor algorithm? 16 5. Deletion Suppose we want to delete a node z. 1. If z has no children, then we will just replace z by nil. 2. If z has only one child, then we will promote the unique child to z’s place. 3. If z has two children, then we will identify z’s successor. Call it y. The successor y either is a leaf or has only the right child. Promote y to z’s place. Treat the loss of
