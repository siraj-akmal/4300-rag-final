int numrecs(); public Key[] keys(); } An important implementation detail to note is that while Figure 12.6.1 shows internal nodes containing three keys and four pointers, class BPNode is slightly different in that it stores key/pointer pairs. Figure 12.6.1 shows the tree as it is traditionally drawn. To simplify implementation in practice, nodes really do associate a key with each pointer. Each internal node should be assumed to hold in the B+ B∗ B+ B+ B+ B+ B+ B+ B+ m m B+ B+ B+ 3/17/25, 9:22 AM 12.6.

Let’s see in some detail how the simplest tree works. This would be the “ tree”, or a tree of order 3. Figure 12.6.2: An example of building a tree Next, let’s see how to search.
