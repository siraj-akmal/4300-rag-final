a response to processing unstructured web-based data. 5 https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-non-relational-databases/ CAP Theorem Review 6 Reference: https://alperenbayramoglu.com/posts/understanding-cap-theorem/ You can have 2, but not 3, of the following: - Consistency*: Every user of the DB has an identical view of the data at any given instant - Availability: In the event of a failure, the database system remains operational - Partition Tolerance: The database can maintain operations in the event of the network’s failing between two segments of the distributed system * Note, the definition of Consistency in CAP is different from that of ACID. CAP Theorem Review 7 Reference: https://alperenbayramoglu.com/posts/understanding-cap-theorem/ - Consistency + Availability: System always responds with the latest data and every request gets a response, but may not be able to deal with network partitions - Consistency + Partition Tolerance: If system responds with data from the distrib. system, it is always the latest, else data request is dropped. - Availability + Partition Tolerance: System always sends are responds based on distributed store, but may not be the absolute latest data. ACID Alternative for Distrib Systems - BASE ●Basically Available ○Guarantees the availability of the data (per CAP), but response can be “failure”/“unreliable” because the data is in an inconsistent
