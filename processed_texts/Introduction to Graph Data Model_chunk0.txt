DS 4300 Introduction to the Graph Data Model Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Material referenced from Graph Algorithms - Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j by Needham and Hodler (O’Reilly Press, 2019) What is a Graph Database - Data model based on the graph data structure - Composed of nodes and edges - edges connect nodes - each is uniquely identiﬁed - each can contain properties (e.g. name, occupation, etc) - supports queries based on graph-oriented operations - traversals - shortest path - lots of others 2 Where do Graphs Show up? - Social Networks - yes… things like Instagram, - but also… modeling social interactions in ﬁelds like psychology and sociology - The Web - it is just a big graph of “pages” (nodes) connected by hyperlinks (edges) - Chemical and biological data - systems biology, genetics, etc. - interaction relationships in chemistry 3 Basics of Graphs and Graph Theory 4 What is a graph? Labeled Property Graph - Composed of a set of node (vertex) objects and relationship (edge) objects - Labels are used to mark a node as part of a group - Properties are attributes (think KV pairs) and can exist on nodes and relationships
