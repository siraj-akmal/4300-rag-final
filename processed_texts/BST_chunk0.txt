Chapter 12: Binary Search Trees A binary search tree is a binary tree with a special property called the BST-property, which is given as follows: ⋆ For all nodes x and y, if y belongs to the left subtree of x, then the key at y is less than the key at x, and if y belongs to the right subtree of x, then the key at y is greater than the key at x. We will assume that the keys of a BST are pairwise distinct. Each node has the following attributes: • p, left, and right, which are pointers to the parent, the left child, and the right child, respectively, and • key, which is key stored at the node. 1 An example 4 2 3 6 5 12 9 8 11 15 19 20 7 2 Traversal of the Nodes in a BST By “traversal” we mean visiting all the nodes in a graph. Traversal strategies can be speciﬁed by the ordering of the three objects to visit: the current node, the left subtree, and the right subtree. We assume the the left subtree always comes before the right subtree. Then there are three strategies. 1. Inorder.
