to store a chunk that is the size of a disk block, or a small multiple of the disk block size. If the next record to be inserted belongs to a chunk that hasnâ€™t filled its block then we can just insert it there. The fact that this might cause other records in that chunk to move a little bit in the array is not important, since this does not cause any extra disk accesses so long as we move data within that chunk. But what if the chunk fills up the entire block that contains it? We could just split it in half. What if we want to delete a record? We could just take the deleted record out of the chunk, but we might not want a lot of near-empty chunks. So we could put adjacent chunks together if they have only a small amount of data between them. Or we could shuffle data between adjacent chunks that together contain more data. The big problem would be how to find the desired chunk when processing a record with a given key. Perhaps some sort of tree-like structure could be used to locate the appropriate chunk.
