Distributing Data - Beneﬁts 2 - Scalability / High throughput: Data volume or Read/Write load grows beyond the capacity of a single machine - Fault Tolerance / High Availability: Your application needs to continue working even if one or more machines goes down. - Latency: When you have users in different parts of the world you want to give them fast performance too Distributed Data - Challenges - Consistency: Updates must be propagated across the network. - Application Complexity: Responsibility for reading and writing data in a distributed environment often falls to the application. 3 Vertical Scaling - Shared Memory Architectures - Geographically Centralized server - Some fault tolerance (via hot-swappable components) 4 Vertical Scaling - Shared Disk Architectures - Machines are connected via a fast network - Contention and the overhead of locking limit scalability (high-write volumes) … BUT ok for Data Warehouse applications (high read volumes) 5 AWS EC2 Pricing - Oct 2024 6 > $78,000/month https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/ Horizontal Scaling - Shared Nothing Architectures ●Each node has its own CPU, memory, and disk ●Coordination via application layer using conventional network
