nodes - EX: Social Network Inﬂuencers? - Community Detection - evaluate clustering or partitioning of nodes of a graph and tendency to strengthen or break apart 18 Centrality 19 Some Famous Graph Algorithms - Dijkstra’s Algorithm - single-source shortest path algo for positively weighted graphs - A* Algorithm - Similar to Dijkstra’s with added feature of using a heuristic to guide traversal - PageRank - measures the importance of each node within a graph based on the number of incoming relationships and the importance of the nodes from those incoming relationships 20 Neo4j - A Graph Database System that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data - Relatively new class of no-sql DBs - Considered schema optional (one can be imposed) - Supports various types of indexing - ACID compliant - Supports distributed computing - Similar: Microsoft CosmoDB, Amazon Neptune 21 ?? 22
