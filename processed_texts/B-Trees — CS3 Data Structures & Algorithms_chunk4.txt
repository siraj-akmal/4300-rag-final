a record with key value 47. B-tree insertion is a generalization of 2-3 tree insertion. The first step is to find the leaf node that should contain the key to be inserted, space permitting. If there is room in this node, then insert the key. If there is not, then split the node into two and promote the middle key to the parent. If the parent becomes full, then it is split in turn, and its middle key promoted. Note that this insertion process is guaranteed to keep all nodes at least half full. For example, when we attempt to insert into a full internal node of a B-tree of order four, there will now be five children that must be dealt with. The node is split into two nodes containing two keys each, thus retaining the B-tree property. The middle of the five children is promoted to its parent. 12.6.1.1. B+ Trees The previous section mentioned that B-trees are universally used to implement large-scale disk-based systems. Actually, the B-tree as described in the previous section is almost never implemented. What is most commonly implemented is a variant of the B-tree, called the tree. When greater efficiency is required, a
