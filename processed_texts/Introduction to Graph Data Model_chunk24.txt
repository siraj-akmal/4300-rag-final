Famous Graph Algorithms - Dijkstra’s Algorithm - single-source shortest path algo for positively weighted graphs - A* Algorithm - Similar to Dijkstra’s with added feature of using a heuristic to guide traversal - PageRank - measures the importance of each node within a graph based on the number of incoming
