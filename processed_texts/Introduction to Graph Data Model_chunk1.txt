Graph Theory 4 What is a graph? Labeled Property Graph - Composed of a set of node (vertex) objects and relationship (edge) objects - Labels are used to mark a node as part of a group - Properties are attributes (think KV pairs) and can exist on nodes and relationships - Nodes with no associated relationships are OK. Edges not connected to nodes are not permitted. 5 Example 2 Labels: - person - car 4 relationship types: - Drives - Owns - Lives_with - Married_to Properties 6 Paths A path is an ordered sequence of nodes connected by edges in which no nodes or edges are repeated. 7 1 2 3 6 5 4 Ex: 1 → 2 → 6 → 5 Not a path: 1 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 3 Flavors of Graphs Connected (vs. Disconnected) – there is a path between any two nodes in the graph Weighted (vs. Unweighted) – edge has a weight property (important for some algorithms) Directed (vs. Undirected) – relationships (edges) deﬁne a start and end node Acyclic (vs. Cyclic) – Graph contains no cycles 8 Connected vs. Disconnected 9 Weighted vs. Unweighted 10 Directed vs. Undirected 11 Cyclic vs
