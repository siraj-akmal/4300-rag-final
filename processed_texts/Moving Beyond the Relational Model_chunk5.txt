So what? Distributed Data when Scaling Out A distributed system is “a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as one computer.” -Andrew Tennenbaum Characteristics of Distributed Systems: - computers operate concurrently - computers fail independently - no shared global clock 15 Distributed Storage - 2 Directions 16 Single Main Node Distributed Data Stores - Data is stored on > 1 node, typically replicated - i.e. each block of data is available on N nodes - Distributed databases can be relational or non-relational - MySQL and PostgreSQL support replication and sharding - CockroachDB - new player on the scene - Many NoSQL systems support one or both models - But remember: Network partitioning is inevitable! - network failures, system failures - Overall system needs to be Partition Tolerant - System can keep running even w/ network partition 17 The CAP Theorem 18 The CAP Theorem 19 The CAP Theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: - Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or error thrown - Availability - Every request receives a (non-error) response - but no guarantee that
