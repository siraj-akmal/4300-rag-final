which are populated on the server side from either parameters sent in with the filter, or from database data in your system. Variables take the form of: {{<variable name>}} Variables should be enclosed in quotes (e.g. '{{variable_name}}' instead of {{variable_name}} ) so that the final objet sent to the server can be marked as valid JSON. Variables are not escaped when used as part of a filter or query - only constants can be escaped by Backand. With this in mind, you want to make sure that variables tied directly to user input are properly sanitized before being sent to the back-end. The SQL statement generated for the filter latest object will include the variables you provide verbatims. The variables will be substituted for the equivalent values prior to the execution of the query. latest
