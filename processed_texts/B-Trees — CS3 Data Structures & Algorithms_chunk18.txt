greater). Because B-trees have become so popular, many algorithm designers have tried to improve B-tree performance. One method for doing so is to use the tree variant known as the tree. The tree is identical to the tree, except for the rules used to split and merge nodes. Instead of splitting a node in half when it overflows, the tree gives some records to its neighboring sibling, if possible. If the sibling is also full, then these two nodes split into three. Similarly, when a node underflows, it is combined with its two siblings, and the total reduced to two nodes. Thus, the nodes are always at least two thirds full. [1] Finally, here is an example of building a B+ Tree of order five. You can compare this to the example above of building a tree of order four with the same records. 5 F 10 S 44 Q 48 E 67 A 88 B 58 A 60 F 12 V 27 T N N N B+ B+ B+ B∗ B∗ B+ B∗ 1 / 33 << < > >> Example B+ Tree Visualization: Insert into a tree of degree 5 3/17/25, 9:22 AM 12.6.
